# Module 1 Code Refactor Challenge EDx

## Description 

Module/Week 1 Challenge Assignment from EDx Web-Dev Bootcamp. The aim of this challenge was to refactor the HTML and CSS code for this website. Changes to the HTML were made for accessability purposes, non-semantic elements were changed to semantic elements. Alt tags were added to images and comments were updated throughout. All links were checked and are now working correctly. Each nav bar link will navigate you to the correct content on the page. The CSS code contained a lot of duplication. Uneccesary classes were removed and all the code was organised under 5 main sections: Global, Nav Bar, Main Content, Benefits Content & Footer. Explicit referencing was used over more general references. The website still maintains the original aesthetic.
